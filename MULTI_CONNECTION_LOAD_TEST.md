## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Test 24 cameras Ã— 2 connections = 48 total connections
python multi_connection_load_test.py 24 --connections-per-camera 2

# Test 30 cameras Ã— 3 connections = 90 total connections  
python multi_connection_load_test.py 30 --connections-per-camera 3

# Test 25 cameras Ã— 4 connections = 100 total connections
python multi_connection_load_test.py 25 --connections-per-camera 4

# Custom duration
python multi_connection_load_test.py 24 --connections-per-camera 2 --duration 180
```

### Real-World Scenarios

| Scenario | Command | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Production Simulation** | `python multi_connection_load_test.py 50 --connections-per-camera 2` | Simulate 50 cameras with 2 viewers each |
| **Heavy Load Testing** | `python multi_connection_load_test.py 25 --connections-per-camera 4` | Test 25 cameras with 4 concurrent viewers |
| **Capacity Discovery** | `python multi_connection_load_test.py 20 --connections-per-camera 5` | Find maximum load with high viewer count |

## Capacity Estimation Logic

### Connection vs Camera Relationship
- **Current Test**: 24 cameras Ã— 2 connections = 48 total server load
- **Capacity Estimation**: If 48 connections are stable, estimate ~240 unique cameras (single viewer scenario)

### Deployment Scenarios
1. **Single Viewer**: Each camera has 1 connection â†’ Full estimated capacity
2. **Dual Viewer**: Each camera has 2 connections â†’ 50% of estimated capacity  
3. **Multi Viewer**: Each camera has 4 connections â†’ 25% of estimated capacity

## FR Deployment Strategy

### For 100+ Camera Target

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy 50 cameras (conservative start)
2. **Phase 2**: Scale to 80-100 cameras based on performance
3. **Phase 3**: Monitor and optimize before further scaling

### Monitoring Requirements
- CPU usage during FR processing
- Memory consumption per camera stream  
- Network bandwidth utilization
- FR processing latency per frame

### Risk Assessment
- **100+ Camera Feasibility**: Automatically assessed based on test results
- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Identified and flagged in recommendations
- **Resource Optimization**: Specific suggestions for infrastructure improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Connection Tracking
```python
# Each connection gets unique tracking
connection_id = f"camera_{camera_id}_conn_{connection_number}"
```

### Statistics Separation
- **Connection Level**: Individual performance per stream
- **Camera Level**: Aggregated performance per unique camera
- **System Level**: Overall capacity and resource utilization

### Capacity Calculation
```python
# Conservative estimation with safety buffer
estimated_max_connections = successful_connections / utilization_rate
unique_camera_capacity = estimated_max_connections / connections_per_camera
```
